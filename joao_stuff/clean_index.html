					I’d be happy if 37signals is the last place I work. In an industry so focused on the booms and busts, I find myself a kindred spirit with the firms of old. Places where people happily reported to work for 40 years, picking up a snazzy gold watch at the end as a token of life-long loyalty.</p>

				Since the beginning, Basecamp has been marketed as a collaboration tool for small businesses (or small groups inside larger businesses).
However, over the years we’ve also heard from many thousands of people who use Basecamp outside of work. They’ve turned to Basecamp to help them manage home improvement projects, hobby projects, volunteer projects, school projects, weddings, etc.</p>

<p>But one complaint we’ve heard is… Basecamp is priced for businesses, not for personal side projects.
So today we’re going to make it easier for people to use Basecamp for their non-work projects. </p>
<p>Today we launch Basecamp Personal.</p>
